This are my dotfiles configurations.

A dotfile is a Unix file starting with a dot (period) that saves the
configuration for many of our Unix programs.

In fact, you are seeing a fraction of my current $HOME directory.

_When is it time to backup your configuration files?_ ::
I started backing up my dotfiles after some time of using *i3 window manager*
and *neovim editor* as my daily tools to program and in general, to use the
computer.

== Programs

This are the programs/tools I usually install after the installation of
*ArcoLinux* OS:

=== Official repositories

* `lsd`: Alternative to _ls_
* `bat`: Replacement of _cat_
* `neovim`: Alternative to _vim_
* `texlive-most`: LaTeX packages
* `node`: NodeJS and npm
* `qalculate-gtk`: Calculator
* `okular`: PDF viewer
* `qt5ct`: Qt5 theme manager
* `konsole`: Another terminal emulator
* `geogebra`: Function plotter

=== AUR 

* `nerd-fonts-hack`: Fonts and icons
* `shell-color-scripts`: Alternative utility to _neofetch_
* `xournal`: PDF editor
* `mailspring`: Mail manager
* `equalx`: LaTeX equation maker
* `drawio-desktop`: Diagram program
* `typora`: Markdown editor
* `losslesscut-bin`: Video cutter

=== Snap

* `shutter`: Video cutter

== Workflow

//=== Global keybinding for WMs

=== Window Manager

== Backup technique

I am using a _git bare repository_ to backup my dotfiles as suggested by DT on
Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM&t=2s[video]), whom at the
same time is using the following 
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles[article from Atlassian] 

=== Git bare repository setup

If you what to have your dotfiles backup do the following:

[NOTE]
Firstly, I recommend to look at the concept of a _git bare repository_

==== 1. Create a bare repository

Create a bare repository wherever it suit you. I have it in a separe partition
from the operative system (that is in fact where I place all my files). Use the
following git command:

[source,sh]
git init --bare <path>

This will create a git repository which have objects we normally do not touch,
but that make our repository database work (for example, HEAD is save here).

==== 2. Link the bare repository with a worktree

Now we need the bare repository to (kind of) point to a specific folder, call
the _worktree_ (normally the worktree and the repository are in the same
directory and you identified the repo by a hidden directory called _.git_).

Anyway, if none of that is clear, Just do the following:

[source,sh]
echo "alias dot='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=<path-to-bare-repo> --work-tree=$HOME'"
>> ~/.bashrc

.Observations
* You can name the alias as you please, in this case I called it _dot_
* The command creates a permanent alias in your .bashrc, however you can created
  manually
* As additional information: Somme of us prefered to save the aliases in
  ~/.bashrc-personal or ~/.zshrc-personal if you are using *zsh shell*

Reload your shell as you like (close it and open if you do not know of any other
way).

Finally, you are ready to use commands such as 

[source,sh]
dot status 
dot add <dotfile> 
dot commit 
dot push origin master

==== 3. Hide untracked files

Some articles advise to hide the untracked files records when you check the
repository status.

Personally I didn't did it because the status guide me to se what I wanted to
backup. Anyway, maybe I will hide the status later so here it is

[source,sh]
dot config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

*IMPORTANT:* I didn't use the above command but as a consecuence I create a
_.gitignore file_ whichi I think is a fair solution for the moment.


==== 4. Create a README file (optional)

Finally I create this file using _asciidoc_ syntax under the _.github_ directory
in my home directory. I din't want to have a README file in my home directory
but I want it to be in the repo, for that reason is in _.github_

==== 5. Start commit the the dotfiles 

The last step is to add and commit every important file I have. The process is
exaclty the same as if you where is a normal repository, except, instead of
using _git_ you have to use _dot_. For example:

[source,sh]
dot add .zshrc
dot commit -m "added zsh shell configuration" 
dot push origin master
